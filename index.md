introduction: |
  We are a new research group based in the [Section of Structural and Synthetic Biology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/infectious-disease/research/structural-bio/){:target="_blank"} in the [Department of Infectious Disease](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/infectious-disease/){:target="_blank"} at **Imperial College London**. Our group uses 3D printing and fluidic technologies to:
  
  - Build new microbiome models for understanding host-microbial community relationship
  
  - Build synthetic tissues for controlling living tissues
  
  - Build new engineered living materials.
