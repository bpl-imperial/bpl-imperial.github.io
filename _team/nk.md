*Biography*

Hi, I'm Natasha! My MRes project involves 3D printing microbial communities for ELM production and functionalisation. I am supervised by Dr Ravinash Krishna Kumar and [Professor Tom Ellis](https://www.tomellislab.com/){:target="_blank"}. Outside the lab, I enjoy dancing and spend my free time dragging my course mates to salsa and bachata classes.
