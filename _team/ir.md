*Biography*

I am a [Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) Fellow](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/postdoctoral-fellowships){:target="_blank"} at the BioPattern Lab, [Korcsmaros Lab](https://www.korcsmaroslab.org){:target="_blank"} and the [NIHR Imperial BRC Organoid Facility](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/facilities/organoid-facility/){:target="_blank"}, investigating the fundamental question of how microbial spatial arrangement within the gut's mucus layer affects intestinal homeostasis and host-microbe interactions. 

I received a Masters degree in Biomedical Sciences from Hasselt University (Diepenbeek, Belgium) with a focus on Environmental Health Sciences. I then went on to do a PhD in Bioengineering at Ghent University (Ghent, Belgium), where I developed and optimized an in vitro model to model host microbe interactions in the small intestine. Before starting the HFSP fellowship in June 2025, I was a Research Associate in Organoid Culturing at the NIHR Imperial BRC Organoid Facility.
