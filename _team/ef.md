*Biography*

I graduated in 2005 from the University of London with a BSc in Molecular Cell Biology. I worked as a laboratory technician ever since, mostly in part time due to family commitments. I was at the Bacteriology Department at Great Ormond Street Hospital for 6 years, followed by another 6 years at University College London, then, since 2015, I am at Imperial College, first working at Synthetic Biology and now at the Department of Infectious Diseases.
In our labs I prepare media, check and re-fill consumables, keep an eye on our equipment and organize recycling. I also monitor lab practices so our health and safety requirements are soundly met.
I make sure I am available to everyone in the lab thorough the day for discussing any work-related issues, so a high standard, reliable workflow can be coordinated successfully.
My free time is divided between my art studio where I work with clay, making mostly sculpture and ceramics; as well as spending lots of time walking, trekking and just enjoying being outdoors.
