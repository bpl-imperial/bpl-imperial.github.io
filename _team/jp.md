*Biography*

I am an [MRes Systems and Synthetic Biology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/systems-synthetic-biology/){:target="_blank"} student, currently undertaking my research project in the BPL supervised by Ravinash Krishna Kumar and [Claudia Contini](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/c.contini){:target="_blank"}. I recently completed my undergraduate studies in Biological Sciences at Imperial . My main interests are the applications of cell-free systems and computational biology. In my research project I am exploring cell-free gene logic gates in lipid droplets with in vitro transcription-translation.
