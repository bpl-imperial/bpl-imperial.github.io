*Biography*

I am the Laboratory Manager for the Section of Structural and Synthetic Biology in the Department of Infectious Diseases. I completed my undergraduate studies in Malaysia, earning a BSc in Chemistry. I was then awarded a PhD scholarship by The University of Manchester and graduated with a PhD in Pharmaceutical Chemistry, specialising in cancer research drug discovery (2010â€“2013).
Immediately after my PhD, I joined Imperial College London as a Research Associate and participated in several research projects, including antifungal drug discovery, automation, and proteomics and metabolomics analysis using mass spectrometry for synthetic biology research. One of my publications that I am most proud of is the development of a [semi-automated rapid workflow](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00243){:target="_blank"} that can analyse betulinic acid (a natural product with potent antitumour activity) in 1,000 samples within 48 hours, from the colony picking step to LC-MS analysis. 
I developed an interest in laboratory management and operations while working in the lab, which led me to my current role as a Lab Manager.
