*Biography*

I graduated from Warsaw University of Life Sciences (BSc in Biotechnology 2012, MRes in Biotechnology 2014). I then joined Prof. Piotr Garstecki to work on miniaturization of microbiological and chemical assays in microdroplets, publishing on emulsification physics and devices for high throughput analysis of antimicrobial resistance at the level of single cells. I graduated with honours in 2019 (PhD in Physical Chemistry 2019). I received a fellowship from the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) to work for two years at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA at the lab of Prof. Paul Blainey; however, the pandemic forced me to postpone this until 2022. In the meantime, I joined the lab of Dr Bartek Waclaw to study biofilm population dynamics in microfluidics, which led to a major discovery that bacterial population structure can be passively controlled by changing the shape of the surface on which bacteria grow. At the Broad, I worked on establishing an optical pooled screen of Salmonella infection in macrophages. After this, I joined the BPL in 2024 to pursue the engineering-based science of bacterial behaviour in confined spaces with applications in medical surface industry, skin pores, and colon crypts. I was recently awarded a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship in collaboration with Prof. Sujit Datta at Caltech and Paris-based capillary printing company Hummink to study multispecies biofilm growth dynamics on uneven surfaces.
