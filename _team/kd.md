*Biography*

Kush is PhD researcher in the MPL, as part of the [EPSRC CDT in BioDesign Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/synthetic-biology/cdt-biodesign-engineering/){:target="_blank"}, co-supervised with [Professor Geoff Baldwin](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.baldwin){:target="_blank"} and [Professor Karen Polizzi](https://sites.google.com/site/polizzilab/home){:target="_blank"}. He is exploring communication in the gut microbiota between hosts and commensals. He is interested in the development of minimal systems to understand microbiome complexity. Towards this he is developing a printed model of Bacteroides spp interactions as well as genetically encoded evolved biosensors for small molecules. Kush also spent a year of his PhD at Harvard Medical School with [Professor Marco Jost](https://www.jostlab.org/){:target="_blank"} looking at aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signalling and Bacteroides genetic engineering.
 
In his free time Kush is an avid Arsenal fan whose mood on Monday is often influenced by their success / failure at the weekend. He enjoys coding and has been known to spend 10 hours automating a task that takes 10 minutes to do manually. Kush requires 4 coffees per day to survive but believes this habit is unrelated to his insomnia.
