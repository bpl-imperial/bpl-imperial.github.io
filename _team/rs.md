*Biography*

Rohan is an EPSRC-funded PhD student at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Chemical Biology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemical-biology/cdt/){:target="_blank"}, co-supervised by Dr. Yuval Elani and Professor Karen Polizzi. His research focuses on 3D printing synthetic tissues to enable patterned interactions with cellular populations. He is particularly interested in developing synthetic systems that can sense and respond to cellular signals and is currently working toward constructing such systems.

In the lab, Rohan also takes on the role of ‘engineer,’ developing a new 3D printer for producing synthetic tissues. He aims to expand the range of bio-inks the printer can handle while improving its efficiency and usability.

Before starting his PhD, Rohan earned an undergraduate degree in Chemistry from Durham University, followed by an MRes in Biological and Physical Chemistry at Imperial College London. During his MRes, he worked with Dr. Francesco Aprile and Professor Fernando Bresme on protein aggregation in Parkinson’s disease, using molecular dynamics simulations and microbiology techniques to explore phase-separated aggregation pathways.

Outside the lab, Rohan enjoys cooking, reading, and playing sports.
