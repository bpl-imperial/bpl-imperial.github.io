*Biography*

I am a [Postdoc.Mobility Fellow](https://www.snf.ch/en/XIZpfY3iVS5KRRoD/funding/careers/postdoc-mobility){:target="_blank"} working on metabolic cross feeding in minimal gut communities and the role that local environment plays in shaping community dynamics. As part of this work, we aim to develop novel gut-on-chip platforms that will allow live-cell imaging of gut community development.

I received an integrated Masters degree in Physics at the University of Edinburgh where I developed a keen interest in applying physical concepts and tools to study microbes. I then went to ETH Zurich to perform PhD research on a highly collaborative project developing microfluidics-based tools for studying bacterial interactions and phenotypic heterogeneity. I moved to Imperial College London in March 2025 funded through a Postdoc.Mobility Fellowship from the [Swiss National Science Foundation](https://www.snf.ch/en){:target="_blank"}.
