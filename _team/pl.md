*Biography*

I am a [MRes Biomedical Research](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/biomedical-research/){:target="_blank"} student completing my second rotational project under the supervision of Dr. Ravinash Krishna Kumar. I earned my BSc in Biochemistry from Imperial College London in 2023 and started my current MRes shortly after. I became deeply interested in synthetic biology, especially the practical applications of bioscience, after my first MRes project in [Dr. David Riglarâ€™s lab](https://www.riglarlab.com){:target="_blank"}. For my project in the BioPattern Lab, I will be investigating the spread of antibiotic resistance within biofilms using microfluidic device.
