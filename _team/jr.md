*Biography*

I received a BSc in Biomimetics from the Westphalian University (Germany) in 2017. Subsequently, I graduated with an MSc in Neuroscience from the University of Freiburg (Germany) in 2020, focusing on computational neuroscience and neurotechnology. My dissertation involved both the experimental investigation of neurotoxicity in brain organoids composed of dopaminergic neurons and the development of a data mining approach for neurotoxic risk assessment at the Johns Hopkins University (USA).

My DPhill is generously funded by the [Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom](https://www.freiheit.org/de){:target="_blank"}
