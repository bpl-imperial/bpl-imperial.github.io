*Biography*

I am a first-year PhD student in the BioPattern Lab, supervised by Dr. Ravinash Krishna Kumar with [Dr. David Riglar](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/d.riglar){:target="_blank"} as my secondary supervisor. My research project involves using 3D printing and droplet microfluidics to study the impact of micron-scale spatial structure on the interactions of bacterial communities of the gut microbiome.

Before starting my PhD, I completed an integrated masterâ€™s in biology at the University of Manchester. During my final year, I worked at the Manchester Fungal Infection Group laboratory, studying the differential ability of heterogeneous isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus to compete with Pseudomonas aeruginosa during coinfection of the cystic fibrosis lung.

In my free time, I enjoy swimming, Nintendo games, live music and relaxing with my cats.
