### Project

Bacteria often live together and interact with each other in densely packed communities. Such communities live in our digestive tract and are essential for our health. Critically, changes in the community diversity (number of species), productivity (total biomass), and structure (who-is-next-to-who) can lead to chronic and life-threatening diseases. It is a great challenge to study and understand these bacterial communities, especially at the micrometre length-scales at which they naturally occur. New methods are urgently needed to build simplified bacterial communities that capture the complex arrangements and interactions of different bacteria found within us.

To fill this gap, we have developed a new droplet-based 3D printing technology for building micrometre structured bacterial communities. We now want to apply this technology to understand the structure/function relationships of our gut microbiota, in particular, the Bacteroides. These are one of the most abundant anaerobic groups of bacteria in our gut responsible for nutrition, pathogen protection, and immune training. We aim to use our printing technology to interrogate how community structure controls the diversity and productivity of Bacteroides communities, and in turn, how they provide us with health benefits.

### Goals

The goals of this PhD project will be to:<br>
1)	develop our technologies to be able to print anaerobic Bacteroides gut strains<br>
2)	develop real-time imaging of printed Bacteroides communities<br>
3)	use this technology to understand how to build diverse and productive Bacteroides communities through changing the spatial patterning of species<br>

### Microbiome Printing Lab (visit our group webpage [here](https://mpl-group.github.io/){:target="_blank"} for more information)

Our research group focuses on building tractable gut microbiome models using 3D printing and flow systems. With this work, we hope to set a new standard for in vitro models of our gut microbiome, where we will be able to image in real time the development of gut bacterial communities (which is currently not possible when using mouse models). To achieve these objectives, we will collaborate with [Professor Laurie Comstock (University of Chicago)](https://comstocklab.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"} who is a world-expert in Bacteroides molecular biology, and with [Professor Kevin Foster (University of Oxford)](https://zoo-kfoster.zoo.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} who is world-expert in microbial ecology and evolution.

Our research group prioritises a healthy research culture, collaboration, and flexible work hours as needed. I will provide a personalised mentorship, including working towards different career choices following the PhD.
