### Postoctoral Research Associates and Fellows

**Open PDRA position in 3D bioprinting and device engineering***
We have a 3 year PDRA position (with potential to extend for another year) to start from March 2024. The aim is to develop 3D printing and transwell techonolgies to create new co-culture systems of gut bacteria and the host. This is funded by our [EPSRC Open Fellowship](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/X010961/1) on 'Building the gut microbiome'{:target="_blank"}.

Informal enquires are most welcome. Please contact Dr Ravinash Krishna Kumar (<ravinash.kumar@imperial.ac.uk>).

We will soon be opening another PDRA positions in gut mucosid models funded by our [EPSRC Open Fellowship](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/X010961/1){:target="_blank"} on 'Building the gut microbiome'. The posts will be for 3 years with potential to extended for a nother year depedent on funding.

### Postgraduate and undergraduate students 

**Open PhD studentship in anaerobic 3D printing of gut bacterial communities**
We have one open PhD studentship to start from Feb-October 2024 funded by Imperial College London. The aim is to use our 3D printing technology to understand structure function relationships in gut bacterial communites.
