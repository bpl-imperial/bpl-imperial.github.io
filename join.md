### Recruitment statement
We know that great science comes from different perspectives. Our team includes people from all sorts of backgrounds, and that’s something we really value. We're always looking for curious, motivated folks who share our excitement for doing meaningful science—no matter where they’re coming from. If that sounds like you, you’ll fit right in here. We’re committed to creating a place where everyone feels welcome, supported, and treated fairly. That means no discrimination, equal opportunities for all, and a genuinely inclusive environment. We encourage people to apply regardless of age, background, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, or family circumstances.

### Postoctoral Research Associates and Fellows

If you're interested in joining the lab as a postdoctoral researcher, please email your CV to Ravinash. We welcome motivated scientists with a strong research vision and encourage applications from those interested in pursuing independent projects.

Our lab has a strong track record of supporting postdoctoral fellows, with three fellows currently working with us. We actively support applications to competitive fellowship schemes, and provide mentorship throughout the application process.
