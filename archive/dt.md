*Biography*

Hello, I'm David, I am a Postgraduate Research student supervised by [Dr. Claudia Contini](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/c.contini){:target="_blank"} and Dr. Ravinash Krishna Kumar. My MRes project is on 3D-bioprinted multi-responsive artificial tissue models that incorporate both bacterial and artificial cells. I previously completed an MEng in Design Engineering at Imperial College London (class of 2023). Personal curiosity and the excitement of exoloring a new and dynamic field are the main reasons why I leaped between engineering and synthetic biology.  
 
Outside of work life, I enjoy getting dragged into Salsa and Bachata classes, and Bouldering sessions by my coursemates and always look forward to try new things. I play the piano as a hobby for the joy of playing solo and as an accompanist. I regularly train and compete with the Imperial College Taekwondo Club (ICUTKD) for national A-class Poomsae competitions.
