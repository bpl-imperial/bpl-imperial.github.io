  - Build new microbiome models for understanding host-microbial community relationship
  - Build synthetic tissues for controlling living tissues
  - Build new engineered living materials. 

  Our group is highly interdisciplinary and spans 3D printing, method development, materials science, microbiology/cell biology, ecology, and modelling.
